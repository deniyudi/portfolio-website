In this post I want to tell you about my workplace and the accessories I use while working. For this reason, I leave the links and resources that make up my desktop. So here you go!

For the record, I currently work as a mobile QA engineer. I spend a lot of hours on the computer, testing, improving the project you're reading this post on, and learning new things. So I put together a desk that allows me to be productive in these areas.

## The Desk

Creating an efficient workspace is critical to productivity. I had the honor of testing [VANDBORG](https://jysk.ua/ofis/stil-kompyuterniy/stil-pysmovyy-vandborg-60kh120-dub/chorn), which is as convenient as possible. Moreover, its aesthetics match its functionality.

## Monitors and Lighting

A high-quality monitor is a must for my work, and I've chosen the Dell U2312HMt. Its ergonomic stand offers complete control over screen positioning, allowing me to customize my view.

## Computer Setup

My main peripherals that I use every day are the Dell U2312HMt monitor, the Hator ROCKFALL EVO TKL keyboard, which does not take up much space on my desk. and the Logitech G402 mouse, which is very comfortable and fits perfectly in the palm of your hand.

## Audio

Audio quality is critical to my workflow. I prefer to immerse myself in the world of sound using headphones, primarily Apple AirPods 2, known for their high-quality sound. It's worth noting that I rely on my headphones due to the limited quality of my main headphones. But it's temporary.

## Peripherals

I'm a mechanical keyboard enthusiast and my current favorite is the Hator ROCKFALL EVO TKL. For efficient navigation, I rely on the Logitech G402, which offers additional buttons and ergonomic comfort. I also like to play my favorite playlist on the Apple iPad Air M1 in the background.

- [Razer Desk Mat](https://www.razer.com/gaming-mouse-mats/razer-pro-glide/RZ02-03331500-R3U1): A functional desk mat that improves both aesthetics and organization.
