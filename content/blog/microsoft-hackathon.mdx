## The Trip

This trip was very exciting. Everyone was waiting to meet each other and go on a trip to another city to the Noosphere planetarium. After two years of reconstruction, the company invited us to see how they arranged everything and changed it.

## Noosphere planetarium

Founded in 1968, the Planetarium is the property of the city community and a center for popularizing space education among children and youth of Dnipro and the region. However, before the start of major repairs, the building and equipment of the institution were in an extremely unsatisfactory condition.

In 2018, the support of the public organizations "Aerospace Museum Center of Culture and Education of Youth" (AMTSKOM) and "Noosphere Association" in 2018 made it possible to create a new history of the favorite institution of Dnipro residents: Planetarium Noosphere is part of the passionate activity of the project partners, aimed at creating favorable conditions for the development of the generation of the new era. The purpose of the overhaul is to create a Planetarium accessible to everyone, because the potential audience of the institution is almost 6 million visitors not only from Dnipropetrovsk, but also from neighboring regions, among which more than a million are children and young people.

## Tour of the planetarium

And so we arrived at our destination. We were met by the Noosphere planetarium team. They greeted us joyfully, and we began the fascinating story of the reboot of the planetarium, and about our universe.

There were a lot of interesting exhibits inside the planetarium. Most of them were interactive. And when pointing at some area, some movement or sound occurred from the exhibit.

There were 3 halls inside the planetarium.

- Hall with all exhibits
- A huge hall for watching a film about our universe
- Hall with VR glasses

After the first hall, we were taken to the second to watch a short video using VR glasses. The video was quite interesting, but it does not compare with when we were taken to the third room to watch the video. It was unbelievable!

## The Final Result

The trip was most interesting. The most important thing is that we all saw each other and lifted each other's spirits. After visiting the city of Dnepropetrovsk, we went to the city of Zaporozhye to continue our team building to play mafia.
